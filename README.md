# Waypoint Plugin Google Cloud Functions

waypoint-plugin-cloudfunctions is a deploy (registry, platform & release) plugin
for [Waypoint](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint). It allows you to stage previously built zip artifcats to Google
Cloud Functions and then release the staged deployment and open it to general traffic.

**This plugin is still work in progress, please open an issue for any feedback or issues.**

# Install

````bash
git clone git@github.com:sharkyze/waypoint-plugin-cloudfunctions.git # or gh repo clone sharkyze/waypoint-plugin-cloudfunctions

# Authentication

Please follow the instructions in
the [Google Cloud Run tutorial](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/waypoint/google-cloud-run?in=waypoint/deploy-google-cloud#authenticate-to-google-cloud)
